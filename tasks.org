** `alpha=\"ok\"` generates an error while trying to highlight the occurence of alpha (C-`)
** Files containing defrecord statement don't compile!
* List of Todos
** Init [0/3]

   - [ ] Implement IL asm mode 
   - [ ]  `- Require register highlighing 
   - [ ]  `- Allow move up/down -- through minor mode

   - [ ]      `- Use overlay to do latency
** MSVC Mode [8/10]
   - [X] Vision of how the information should get displayed
   - [X] Learning ewok
   - [X] Extracting project / deps / build mode from the sln file

   - [X] Introduction of the folders
   - [X] New items added must repect the user view (be hidden or not depending on the view)
   - [ ] Integration of the configuration and platform
   - [ ] Allow project builds 
** Project buffer mode [8/17]
   - [X] C-x C-d on any file should bring the proper directory -- useful??? (waived)
   - [X] 'm' on project should mark every file in this project
   - [X] 'm' on a folder should mark every file under that folder
   - [ ] Added collapse all / expand all for everything and per project!
   - [ ] Add center on project command (C-l?)
   - [ ] show/hide project dependencies
	 e.g: [+] ProjName1           <deps: ProjName3, ProjName2>
   - [X] grayed out exclude from build files?? -- it actually gray out the non-existing files 
   - [X] different color for files referenced in the proj but don't exist?
   - [ ] add command to touch marked files (need a variable to make sure touch is always available)
   - [ ] provide a compile/build marked files command
   - [X] add 'g' to refresh the display
   - [ ] allow 'find corresponding header/source' (need regexps to match one and the other such as: source/header = ( "\.c\(pp\)?" . "\.h\(pp\)?" ) )
   - [X] having a current-pbm to allow build (F7) and run (F5) from anywhere!
	 set-default-pbm; kick-default-pbm-build...
   - [X] having a function which parsed the opened buffer to attach them to the current pbm
   - [ ] look it there is a way to autoload a pbm file from the desktop-load function
	 `- OR see if it's possible to add a post desktop loaded hook -- to reinit the project after loading the desktop data.
   - [ ] Hook up the semantic or any other auto completion tools
   - [ ] Occur in all files in the projects
